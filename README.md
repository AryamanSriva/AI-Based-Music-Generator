# AI-Based-Music-Generator

Generate unique music tracks using Facebook's MusicGen AI model! This project provides both programmatic and interactive interfaces for creating music from text descriptions.

## Features

- **Text-to-Music Generation**: Create music from natural language descriptions
- **Interactive Jupyter Interface**: User-friendly widgets for easy music generation
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Save as WAV files or play directly in notebooks
- **Batch Processing**: Generate multiple variations and explore different genres
- **Flexible Duration Control**: Generate music from 5 seconds to several minutes
- **Genre Variety**: Support for rock, jazz, electronic, classical and more

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### Effective Prompts
- **Be specific**: "upbeat rock song with guitar solo" vs "rock song"
- **Include instruments**: "jazz piano with saxophone"
- **Specify mood**: "relaxing ambient music" or "energetic dance beat"
- **Add genre details**: "80s synthwave" or "country with banjo"

### Example Prompts
```python
prompts = [
    "slow jazz piano ballad with saxophone",
    "upbeat electronic dance music with heavy bass",
    "acoustic folk song with guitar and harmonica",
    "orchestral classical music with strings and piano",
    "reggae song with guitar and steady rhythm",
    "ambient atmospheric soundscape with synthesizers"
]
```

### Performance Tips

- **Use GPU**: Significantly faster generation with CUDA-enabled PyTorch
- **Batch Processing**: Generate multiple tracks in sequence for efficiency
- **Model Caching**: First run downloads model (1-2GB), subsequent runs are faster
- **Memory Management**: Close other applications when generating longer tracks

## Music Generation Tips

### Genre-Specific Prompts

**Rock Music**
```python
prompts = [
    "heavy metal with electric guitar and drums",
    "classic rock ballad with guitar solo",
    "punk rock with fast drums and bass",
    "progressive rock with complex rhythms"
]
```

**Electronic Music**
```python
prompts = [
    "upbeat house music with synthesizers",
    "ambient techno with deep bass",
    "trance music with arpeggiated synths",
    "drum and bass with breakbeats"
]
```

**Acoustic Music**
```python
prompts = [
    "acoustic folk with guitar and vocals",
    "classical piano solo piece",
    "jazz trio with piano bass and drums",
    "bluegrass with banjo and fiddle"
]
```

### Mood and Atmosphere

```python
moods = [
    "relaxing spa music with soft piano",
    "energetic workout music with heavy beats",
    "mysterious film noir soundtrack",
    "uplifting motivational background music",
    "melancholic rainy day acoustic guitar"
]
```
